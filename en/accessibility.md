# Accessibility Statement

Welcome to D-LABS! We are a leading consulting company headquartered in Potsdam. One of our goals is to create innovative and user-friendly products and services in the digital space. It is particularly important to us that our offerings are equally accessible to all people.

This accessibility statement explains to what extent our website [d-labs.com](https://d-labs.com) complies with the accessibility requirements according to legal regulations (BGG and BITV) as well as other guidelines (EN 301 549, BITV 2.0). The statement was created based on a self-test on 01.07.2024 and is continuously updated.

## Non-Accessible Content

Despite our efforts to make our website accessible to all users, regardless of their individual abilities or limitations, our website is only partially accessible. We strive to eliminate the following barriers promptly or provide accessible alternatives.

**1. Alternative Texts:** Our website contains various non-decorative graphics and controls that do not have alternative texts or alt attributes. As a result, these are not properly captured and read aloud by assistive technologies such as screen readers.
**2. Adjustments for Different Screen Orientations:** Some elements on our website are not displayed correctly when there is a change in screen orientation.
**3. PDF Documents:** Not all PDF documents comply with accessibility requirements.
